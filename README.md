💳 Fraud Detection System
🔍 Project Overview

The Fraud Detection System is a machine learning–based application designed to identify fraudulent financial transactions based on transaction behavior patterns. The system analyzes key transaction features and predicts whether a transaction is legitimate or fraudulent.

This project demonstrates how predictive analytics and machine learning can be applied in real-world banking and financial security use cases.

🎯 Key Features

User-friendly web interface using Streamlit

Predicts fraudulent transactions in real time

Uses transaction attributes such as:

Transaction amount

Number of transactions per day

Foreign transaction indicator

Clear and instant prediction results

Beginner-friendly yet industry-relevant implementation

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python

Streamlit – Web application framework

Pandas – Data handling

Scikit-learn – Machine learning

Logistic Regression – Fraud classification model

⚙️ How It Works

User enters transaction details

Input data is processed by the ML model

Logistic Regression predicts transaction type

The system classifies the transaction as:

✅ Legitimate

🚨 Fraudulent

Result is displayed instantly on the UI

🚀 Installation & Usage
pip install streamlit pandas scikit-learn
streamlit run fraud_detection_system.py


The application will automatically open in the browser.

📈 Use Cases

Banking and financial fraud detection

Learning applied machine learning concepts

Academic and portfolio projects

Demonstrating ML-based decision systems

🔮 Future Enhancements

Training with large real-world datasets

Advanced ML models (Random Forest, XGBoost)

Fraud probability scoring

Transaction history visualization

Cloud deployment for public access

💡 Why This Project Stands Out

Practical real-world financial application

Combines ML with an interactive web interface

Easy to understand and explain in interviews

Strong portfolio project for freshers
